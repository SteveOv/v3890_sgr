    A straight line, linear least squares fit to a range of data based on the x & y values being on a log10 scale.
    The slope will be defined and managed in the log10(y) Vs log10(x) domain.
    Client calls for calculating/interacting/querying remains in the linear (x, y) domain.
    Linear (x, Y) values are automatically translated to/from the log10 values as needed.

    Derived from StraightLineLogXFit which manages converting x values to/from log(x) as needed.
